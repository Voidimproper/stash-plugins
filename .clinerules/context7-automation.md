## Brief overview

Global guidelines for automatically leveraging Context7 MCP tools to provide comprehensive documentation and code examples when working with libraries, APIs, and development tasks. These rules ensure that I proactively use Context7 without requiring explicit user requests.

## Automatic Context7 usage triggers

- Automatically resolve library IDs and fetch documentation when generating code that uses external libraries
- Use Context7 when providing setup or configuration instructions for any framework or tool
- Fetch library docs when explaining API usage or implementation patterns
- Resolve library information when troubleshooting or debugging library-specific issues
- Use Context7 when suggesting alternative libraries or comparing different options

## Code generation workflow

- Before writing code that imports or uses external libraries, first resolve the library ID using Context7
- Fetch relevant documentation sections to ensure code examples follow current best practices
- Include appropriate error handling and configuration patterns from official documentation
- Provide setup instructions based on the most up-to-date library documentation

## Documentation accuracy

- Always verify implementation details against current library documentation through Context7
- Use Context7 to check for deprecated methods or recommended alternatives
- Ensure configuration examples match the latest library conventions
- Reference official documentation URLs when providing additional reading

## Proactive assistance

- Use Context7 tools without waiting for explicit requests when library information would be helpful
- Anticipate documentation needs based on the task context and libraries mentioned
- Provide comprehensive examples that follow library best practices
- Include relevant configuration options and common use cases from official docs
